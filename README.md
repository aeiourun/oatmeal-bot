# oatmeal-bot
A script to post markov generated content to myBB forums.

The site I had constructed to run this bot is no longer currently active, more information on that here:

## How-To

Setup and running are a breeze.

Load the files on server, input database and variable information, and run the .php file.

Recomended to be automated through a cronjob.
