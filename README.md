# oatmeal-bot
A script to post markov generated content to myBB forums.

The script will generate semi random markov chain based text, and make a new myBB forum post with that text as a specified user. This is done by inserting the post into the myBB forum database - as well as updating all the other relevant parts of the database for a new forum post.

## How-To

Setup and running are a breeze.

Load the files on server, input database and variable information, and run the .php file.

Recomended to be automated through a cronjob.
